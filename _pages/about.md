<p>I research, design, and develop interactive systems and user experience for emerging technologies and products.</p>

<p>
I am the Digital Experience Lead at Fujitsu, where I build solutions for Digital Twins, XR, and Generative AI technologies.
Previously, I was a Senior HCI researcher at Huawei Canada, creating novel human interfaces and intuitive user experiences for mobile devices, wearables, and vehicles.
In the earlier days, I was building marker-less motion capture solutions using computer vision and deep learning, as well as digital human embodiment in VR.
</p>

<p>My work in HCI is at the intersection of embodied interaction and emerging interfaces, including mobiles, wearables, XR, vehicles, smart home, and Generative AI.</p>
