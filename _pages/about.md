I research, design, and develop interactive systems and user experience for emerging technologies and products.

I am the Digital Experience Lead at Fujitsu, where I build solutions for Digital Twins, XR, and Generative AI technologies.
Previously, I was a Senior HCI researcher at Huawei Canada, creating novel human interfaces and intuitive user experiences for mobile devices, wearables, and vehicles.
In the earlier days, I was building marker-less motion capture solutions using computer vision and deep learning, as well as digital human embodiment in VR.

My work in HCI is at the intersection of embodied interaction and emerging interfaces, including mobiles, wearables, XR, vehicles, smart home, and Generative AI.
