Electrosmog is the electromagnetic radiation emitted from wireless technology such as Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular towers, and poses potential hazard to human. Electrosmog is invisible, and we rely on detectors which show level of electrosmog in a warning such as numbers. Our system is able to detect electrosmog level from number of Wi-Fi networks, connected cellular towers and strengths, and show in an intuitive representation by blurring the vision of the users wearing a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). The HMD displays in real-time the users' augmented surrounding environment with blurriness, as though the electrosmog actually clouds the environment. For demonstration, participants can walk in a video-see-through HMD and observe vision gradually blurred while approaching our prepared dense wireless network.
