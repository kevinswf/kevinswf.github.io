As smart-rings emerge in both research and commercial markets,
their limited physical size remains to restrict the interaction potential and input vocabulary possible. Thus, focusing on touch
interaction for its natural and preferred input potential, this early
work explores the combination of slide and microroll gestures performed by the thumb in continual motion on a smart-ringâ€™s touch
capacitive surface. We frst capture over 3000 slide and microroll
gesture instances, extract features, and generate and test machine
learning models that are able to discern the slide and microroll
gestures within the same touch instance. Through the use of 18
features, our Random Forest model provides a 92.4% accuracy. We
conclude with demonstrations of potential applications utilizing
continual slide and microroll gestures, and a short discussion which
provides future research directions stemming from the positive
results obtained from this preliminary work.
